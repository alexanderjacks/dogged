## Setup after `git clone`. . . maybe, if you're into python & have it set up
- `source startupwi.sh`
- you can _rehydrate_ the data layer from the included markdown (.md) files if you like; just convert them to CSV, then upload those CSVs to Google Drive and make them into Sheets so you can edit them like cloud spreadsheets: the included python(2) scripts will turn CSVs into md files, so just download the CSVs when you're gtg and use those scripts

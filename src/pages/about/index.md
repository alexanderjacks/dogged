title: How This App Exists
---
### Netlify

Cloud development platform, super fast, reliable and FREE TIER.

### React

The grotesque fusion of JavaScript and HTML popularized by facebook and now standard for designing blazingly fast app interfaces.

### Gatsby

A byzantine and genius open source toolchain built around React that offers a new-fangled data layer that jives really well with The Cloud; can generate pseudo-apps from web dev code.

### open source

Software built by dozens or hundreds of volunteers and a few paid folks--or built by 100% volunteers. The opposite of proprietary software because free to use and free to modify/improve.

  There are two major types of quests, story quests and Help Wanted quests.
  Story quests are typically received in the mail, but a few are automatically
  accepted at the beginning of the game to help teach the player about the game.
  Story quests can be completed at any time after receiving them, there is no
  time limit or expiration date.

    Every day the bulletin board outside Pierre's General Store may have a
    randomly generated Help Wanted quest that you can complete in exchange for
    money and sometimes increased friendship with the quest giver. When a new
    quest is available, the bulletin board will have a yellow exclamation point
    floating above it. Rewarded money depends on the number of items/monsters
    involved, the player's skills, and sometimes a bit of randomness. Once you
    have accepted a Help Wanted quest you will have 2 days to complete it, the
    current day and the next.

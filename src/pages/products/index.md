heading: Story vs Help Wanted Quests
description: >-
  There are two major types of quests, story quests and Help Wanted quests.
  Story quests are usually begun via the mail, but some tutorial quests are
  auto-accepted when you start a new farm. Story quests have no time limits or
  expiration dates. Help Wanted quests from outside Pierre's expire at 2am on
  the day after you accept them.

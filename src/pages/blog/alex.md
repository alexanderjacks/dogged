  Alex loves sports and hanging out at the beach. He is quite arrogant and brags
  to everyone that he is going to be a professional athlete. Is his cockiness
  just a facade to mask his crushing self-doubt? Is he using his sports dream to
  fill the void left by the disappearance of his parents? Or is he just a brazen
  youth trying to 'look cool?'

description: >-
  Sebastian is a rebellious loner who lives in his parents’ basement. He is
  Maru’s older half-brother, and feels like his sister gets all the attention
  and adoration, while he is left to rot in the dark. He tends to get deeply
  absorbed in computer games, comic books, and sci-fi novels, and will sometimes
  spend great lengths of time pursuing these hobbies alone in his room. He can
  be a bit unfriendly to people he doesn’t know. Could a charming new farmer
  cultivate the wasteland of his heart? Who knows?

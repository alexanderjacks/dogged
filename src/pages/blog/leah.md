  Leah lives alone in a small cabin just outside of town. She loves to spend
  time outside, foraging for a wild meal or simply enjoying the gifts of the
  season. She’s a talented artist with a large portfolio of work… yet she’s too
  nervous to display it to the public. Maybe you can give her a little
  confidence boost?

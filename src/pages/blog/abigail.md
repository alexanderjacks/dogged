  Abigail lives at the general store with her parents. She sometimes fights with
  her mom, who worries about Abigail’s “alternative lifestyle”. Her mom has the
  following to say: “I wish Abby would dress more appropriately and stop dyeing
  her hair blue. She has such a wonderful natural hair color, just like her
  grandmother did. Oh, and I wish she’d find some wholesome interests instead of
  this occult nonsense she’s into.” You might find Abigail alone in the
  graveyard, or maybe out in a rainstorm looking for frogs.

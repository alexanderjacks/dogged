  Sam is an outgoing, friendly guy who is brimming with youthful energy. He
  plays guitar and drums, and wants to start a band with Sebastian as soon as he
  has enough songs together. However, he does have a habit of starting ambitious
  projects and not finishing them. Sam is a little stressed about the impending
  return of his father, who has been away for years due to his line of work.

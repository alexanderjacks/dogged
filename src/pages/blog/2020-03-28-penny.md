  Penny lives with her mom, Pam, in a little trailer by the river. While Pam is
  out carousing at the saloon, Penny quietly tends to her chores in the dim,
  stuffy room she is forced to call home. She is shy and modest, without any
  grand ambitions for life other than settling in and starting a family. She
  likes to cook (although her skills are questionable) and read books from the
  local library.
